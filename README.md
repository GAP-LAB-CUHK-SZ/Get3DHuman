This is the official PyTorch implementation of [Get3DHuman]().


## TODO:triangular_flag_on_post:

- [ ] Preprocess datasets
- [ ] Pretrained weights
- [ ] Demo
- [ ] Training Code
- [ ] Details about pre-processing your videos.
- [ ] Combine with NeuralUDF (Coming Soon!)

## Requirements

Python 3


Note: A GTX 3090 is recommended to run Get3DHuman, make sure enough GPU memory if using other cards.
